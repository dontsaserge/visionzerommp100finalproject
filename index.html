				The primary mission of government is to protect the public. New York's families deserve and expect safe streets. But today (2014) in New York, approximately 4,000 New Yorkers are seriously injured and more than 250 are killed each year in traffic crashes. Being struck by a vehicle is the leading cause of injury-related death for children under 14, and the second leading cause for seniors. On average, vehicles seriously injure or kill a New Yorker every two hours.
				This status quo is unacceptable. The City of New York must no longer regard traffic crashes as mere "accidents," but rather as preventable incidents that can be systematically addressed. No level of fatality on city streets is inevitable or acceptable. This Vision Zero Action Plan is the City's foundation for ending traffic deaths and injuries on our streets..</i><br>

			<h1>HOW YOU CAN HELP?</h1>
			<p class="message">
				<strong>You can help make our roads safer!!</strong>Since 2014, 
New York City is engaged in a <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/visionzero/index.page" target="blank"><strong>Vision Zero</strong></a> initiative to eliminate traffic deaths on our streets, and we can do our part to make that vision a reality. In January 2014, Mayor Bill De Blasio announced adoption of New York City’s Vision Zero and enumerated a long list of initiatives that city would be following to reduce fatalities on city’s streets. Among the measures it plans to take includes pushing for changes in the State legislature to allow the city more control in the administration of traffic safety measures as speed reduction from 30 miles per hour to 25 miles per hour except where posted. To ensure that every New Yorker is award of Vision Zero and how it works, the city most going through education, law enforcement, street sign. Also, our participation count and we can do something to make our community more safer and New York City a safer place for pedestrians. That is why we design this website to offer the post, so you can download and just by sticking them behind your car or in the frond yard of your house can help save live<br>

<h1>SPECIAL WINTER CAUTION</h1>
